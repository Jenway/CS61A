# My CS61A

My solutions for [CS 61A Spring 2022](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp22)

---

## Feeling

### week 1: Varibles & Functions, Control

Something like intro for programming

### week 2: Control, Higher-Order Functions

> `Higher-Order Functions` is A function that either:
>
> Takes another function as an argument
>
> Returns a function as its result

I shall admit that using Higher-Order Functions and lambda expression is sth novel for me

It's really...abstract and elegant in python to write like that

'cause in C, I shall consider a lot about function pointers

### week 3: Hog

Here comes the 1st project Hog

It's cozy to not consider about function pointers, though they always cross into my mind as I completing the project

So, we abstract and reuse the code we have written, (DRY, Don't Repeat Yourself)

the stuffs had already provided with a fine scaffold

### week 4: Recursion, Tree Recursion

Well, I'm not a smart one that grasp Recursion easily, even now I dare not say I do

What really suprises me is writing a helper function inside a function

> If you need to keep track of more than one value across recursive calls, consider writing a helper function.

And closure as well as Decoration is really cool

Actually most problems can also use loop with a stack to fix

### week 5: Cats

Hmm~ It seems that the project has nothing with cats, expect some picture

> CS 61A Autocorrected Typing Software

And its name of cause

### week 6: Python Lists, Object-Oriented Programming

The `@classmethod` and etc are a bit complex for me, though the course does not require much about it

> Actually did, in the next week 7 project

### week 7: Ants

It looks like the `@classmethod` is more like static methods in C++, as `@staticmethod` cannot access class members

Plus, in python it's really cozy to write a class, you do not need to explicitly declare the instance member before you assign it

However, this also made me forget to add a `self.`, maybe it's just too free

This week also taught `Tree` and `Linkedlist`, as example for `Recursive objects`

### week 8: Iterators, Generators, Efficiency

I had knew about Generators, but I didn't fully understand it

And it's good to implement a Iterator by self

### week 9: Midterm

For now I did not finish any discussion, It's a pity

This week also include Project 0: lambda-ing

### week 10: Break

### week 11: Scheme

### week 12: Scheme Interpreter

#### An annoying BUG

Couldn't pass the tests when working on the extra credit (EC) part of the project, it continuously giving "recursion depth exceeded" error

So I just find other's solutions on GitHub, download and compare

> the solution is from `@1eaff`'s [`ucb-cs61a` repo](https://github.com/1eaff/ucb-cs61a/tree/master/projs/scheme )

After a thorough comparison, I finally noticed a commented section with #EC in the file `scheme_forms.py`

It seems that the crucial change was made in the execution of `scheme_eval` function, where a third parameter was added with the value True. I'm not entirely sure why this modification worked, but it appears to be related to implementing tail recursion optimization. With this change, I needed to manually enable optimization in functions like addition and multiplication. Otherwise, the provided tests , without tail recursion optimization, would just recurse for a too deep depth, and the program just crack

While researching the problem, I also came across the code from `@YinY1` on GitHub, this fellow seems to have faced a similar challenge, leaving a comment in [the code](https://github.com/YinY1/CS61A-su22/blob/master/proj/scheme/scheme_eval_apply.py#L153):

which , like below

``` python
# strange that this is the same as the other answers, but it cannot pass ok test
# so fuck it
```
### week 13: Scheme Data Abstraction, Programs as Data

### week 14: ReExp and BNF

2 declaratice domain-specific languages

### week 15:

Here comes the final and this was the CS61A ! üéá

#### What did we learn?

**_Programming paradigms_**

> Imperative programming: using statements to change a program's state.

```python
nums = [1, 2, 4]
for i in range(0, len(nums)):
    nums[i] = nums[i] ** 2
```

**_Functional programming_**

> expressions, not statements; no side-effects; use of higher-order functions.

```python
list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, [1, 2, 4]))
```

```scheme
(map (lambda (n) (expt n 2)) '(1 2 4))
```

**Object-oriented and data-centric programming**

``` python
innocent_bee = Bee(5)
horrible_ant = Ant(10)
innocent_bee.fend_off(horrible_ant)
```
``` scheme
(define t
    (tree 3
            (list (tree 1 nil)
                (tree 2 (list (tree 1 nil) (tree 1 nil))))))
(map label (branches t))
```
**Declarative programming**

>  State goals or properties of the solution rather than procedures.

``` apl
(.+)@(.+)\.(.{3})
```
```yaml
calc_op: "(" OPERATOR calc_expr* ")"
```
#### Programming concepts

- **Data storage**:
	- Primitive/simple types: booleans, numbers, strings
	- Compound types: lists, linked lists, trees

- **Environments:** rules for how programs access and modify named objects

- **Higher-order functions:** Functions as data values, functions on functions

- **Recursion:** approaching a problem recursively, general recursive patterns

- **Mutability:** mutable objects, mutation operations, dangers of mutation

- **Exceptions:** Dealing with errors

- **Efficiency:** Different programs have different time/space needs

#### Software engineering

- Abstractions, separation of concerns
- Specification of a program vs. its implementation
	- Syntactic spec (header) vs. semantic spec (docstring).
	- Example of multiple implementations for the same abstract behavior
- Testing: for every program, there is a test.

Remember: code isn't just read by computers, it's also read by humans.

#### Practice programming

- Programming puzzles (HackerRank, LeetCode, Euler)

- Programming contests (Advent of Code, Kaggle)

- Hackathons

- More paradigms and languages (Web dev, Embedded)

- The open-source world: Go out and build something!

- Personal projects

- Above all: Have fun!

#### What do you want to do?

There are so many possible programs that haven't been made yet. What will you make?

## Recording

Right now is 14th July of 2023,17:00 PM

And I just finished week 1 to 9,excluding all the discussion

Afterwards coming the Scheme, and I'm gonna take a "week 10" break

Since originally the WEEK 10 is just described as `No Lecture: Spring Break`

I started taking this on Tue Jun 27 2023

____

Now is 4th August of 2023, 15:55 PM

Approximately, I have just finished all the labs, homeworks and projects

Well, actually, except the scheme contest, and the scheme interpreter was not fully completed, leaving some optional part

And, all the discussions

Despite the above, this journey of `CS61A` come to its end, and , it tooks me about a month

Next trip will be CS61B ? or SICP?

well, who know where the wind will blow us to?
